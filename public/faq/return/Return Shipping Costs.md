# Return Shipping Costs

Who pays for return shipping depends on the store’s policies, the reason for the return, and the type of purchase.

---

## 1. Store-Covered Returns

The store may pay for return shipping if:

- The item is **defective, damaged, or incorrect**.
- The store explicitly offers **free returns** as part of its policy.
- The return is due to a **fulfilled online order error** (e.g., wrong item shipped).

---

## 2. Customer-Paid Returns

You may be responsible for return shipping if:

- You are returning the item **for personal reasons** (e.g., changed your mind, ordered the wrong size).
- The item is **on sale or clearance** with limited return support.
- The store’s policy **does not cover return shipping** for buyer’s remorse.

## 3. Tips to Avoid Confusion

- Check the **return policy** before purchasing.
- Look for stores that offer **prepaid return labels** for convenience.
- Keep **tracking numbers** and receipts for the return shipment.
- Contact **customer service** if you are unsure who covers shipping costs.
